# frontend.fyi vanilla starter

This small starter project is used in all frontend.fyi videos where
we focus only on vanilla JavaScript / vanilla Typescript, or in
other words projects that don't use any framework. By doing so we
hope being able to focus on the JavaScript/TypeScript problems
without being distracted by framework specific things.

## But what is included?

* **ParcelJS*: We use Parcel to do all the heavy
lifting for us. Parcel is a very fast "zero" configuration
bundler. This means that pretty much without configuration
Parcel will compile our scripts and show it for us on a locals
webserver that will automatically reload. [Go to the Parcel website](https://parceljs.org/)
* **UIKit**: We use UIKit to load their CSS via a CDN
to make these examples just a little bit more visually appealing
without needing to maintain these styles ourselves ;) You can
compare UIKit to Bootstrap, although I personally think UIKits
looks a bit better. [Go to the UIKit website](https://getuikit.com/)

## How to preview this page?
Open your terminal and run `npm install`. Once that
process is completed you can run `npm start`, that will
start the server, which you can view at
